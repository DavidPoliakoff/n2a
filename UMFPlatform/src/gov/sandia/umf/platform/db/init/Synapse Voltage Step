$metadata
 notes=This synapse directly changes the postsynaptic voltage by a specific increment. Primarily for use in models targeted to the STPU.
A=$connect("Neuron")
B=$connect("Neuron")
B.V=+Vdelta@$event(A.V>=A.Vpeak,0)
Vdelta=10mV
 $metadata
  notes=The desired change in postsynaptic voltage. This does not account for dynamics of the postsynaptic neuron, such as leakage current and voltage resets due to spiking.

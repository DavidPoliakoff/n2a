$metadata
 notes=This synapse delivers a burst of current that lasts only one simulation cycle, attempting to raise the postsynaptic voltage by a specific increment. It is primarily for use in less biologically-realistic spiking networks.
A=$connect("Neuron")
B=$connect("Neuron")
B.V=+Vdelta@$event(A.V>=A.Vpeak,0)
Vdelta=10mV
 $metadata
  notes=The desired change in postsynaptic voltage. This does not account for leakage current or voltage resets due to spiking.

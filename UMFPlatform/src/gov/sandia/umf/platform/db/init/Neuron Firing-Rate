   Sigmoid f-I firing rate relationship
   I_inj = input current; 0 by default
   V_mean = mid-point of f-V sigmoid (V for 50% firing rate)
   V_thresh = approximate voltage at which neuron starts firing
   f_max = max firing rate
   dfdV = slope of firing rate at midpoint voltage
   V_rest = voltage at which neuron returns to in absence of input
   tau = time constant of neuron re-polarization
I_inj=0.0
V=V_rest@init
V'=-1.0/tau*(V-V_rest)+I_inj
V_mean=V_thresh+1.0/dfdV
f=f_max*((1.0+tanh((V-V_mean)*dfdV))/2.0)^2.0/1000.0


This file is an attempt to capture all the "special" variables that N2A has:

Topology:
  $index = used when laying out
  $xyz = used for layout
  $n = used for layout
  Used in gov.sandia.n2a.network package
  Defined in (New)PartSet (for now...)

Resolved during evaluation by EvaluationContext:
  $pi (value of pi)
  $e (value of e)
  
Specific annotations - do these belong elsewhere?
  ANN_INIT = "init"
  Defined in NewPartSet (for now...)
  
Xyce-Specific:
   DEVICE_TAG = "backend.xyce.device";
   PARAM_TAG = "xyce.param";
   NODE_TAG = "xyce.nodeIndex";
   IVAR_TAG = "xyce.internalVar";

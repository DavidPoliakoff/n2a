
Unsorted Items From Friday Before Trip:
* "Add New *" In search box (i.e. reference, part).                                                                                                                 
* Summary Model Layer Vis Height Reduce
* Function params exposed in UI
  - In eqn add/edit dlg
  - In "Help" type library function
  - Add eqn dlg box shows variables avaailable   
* Better Bridge Add Dialog Box
  - Shows chosen layers, can choose which layers connect into which cxn slots
*# Model topo needs open comp/cxn context menus
*# Clean up run dialog
*# Remove developer test record?
* References have owners?  Owned by $N2ASystem prolly?

Save:
* Need better validation consistency.  Saving a blank record produces three diff experiences: Save Button, Ctrl+S, and Ctrl+Shift+S.

Misc:
* Get some good examples, not dummy data
* More general meta data: created by, updated by, created date, updated date. (owner separate? write list?)
*# Units support
* A people search section? And public profiles?
* Uses: Models that contain -- should be easy now.
*# "Dev Test Record" concept should be removed some day. -- really need dev, qual, & prod schemas.

Search:
* More search criteria
* !Tags criteria (& need to search the parent hierarchy's tags)
* Maybe search dialog's results should save on a cancel too??
*# Maybe a results panel that doesn't use a grid, but rather a list that can have an 
  arbitrary panel for the items (so can show icon, and custom text, instead of relying 
  on specific column headings to make sense for all records)
*# Faceted results (like newegg)
*# Google-type search & advanced search

Tabs:
* Update summary progress message overrides closing message for close all (no big deal, but maybe should be using ProgressManager class instead of accessing SB directly)
* Would be nice if we got a progress bar on window closing for close all on exit (many dirty records)
* Would be nice if when you close all, only those with validation errors remained open

Graph:
*- Names overlap on summary graph.
*- Click on circle opens record
*- Parent: underneath circles?  List in corner?
*- Shapes show type (square for connection?)

Equations:
*# Can't add non-equations to the equations table (that was allowed for output variables I think)
* Have to be able to show/edit notes associated with each equation reference in equation tree panel.
* Easily be able to copy a set of equations to text (to email, put in text file), and import from text.
* Table mode for editing.  Want to be able to "hit enter" between equations.
* @ notation should be a part of equation and only relates to context.
* Metadata on equations for all other previously-@ related information

Model:
* Think about inputs/outputs more
*# Run panel needs execution environment

Run:
* Need to have a "snapshot" of the model and Xyce netlist stored with the run.

Random Ideas:
* Add a "copied/duplicated from" flag and display it?
* Change history? (placeholder in UI)
* References (part/model/eqn level) (placeholder in UI)
* Tools,Options
* Potential: Preferences on summary tree org

Permissions:
* Owner
* Managers (can change permissions list)
* Editors
* Viewers

Persistence:
* Think about some protection mechanism making sure you can't save a record that has already been saved since you read the record.
*# Switch persistence to non-SQL DB?
*- Should be able to switch to a local file using XStream.  How about an H2 implementation?  Now we have an embeddable database. 

Matrix Syntax
* [1 2 3; 1 2 3]

Core:
* Need some sort of notifier/lister on other records being changed related to parent/include/connect.
* Need listeners for deleting causes tab panel to remove a tab.  It should subscribe to the model right??
* Persist tags for parts, models, and references.
* Could remove item from search results if it's in the search results (the deleted record)!

Summary:
* Need help for each summary section.????

Help:
* Add more help
* Create main help

Workpane
* Prolly need to implement the -N for new beans -- there's really no downside, but will enable certain UI operations greatly (right now it's hard to write
extra code to handle the case where a bunch of beans' IDs are all null.
* selecting a NEW record from my work or recently viewed pane causes errors. -- make sure these are not written out.  also, should be using -UIDs to fix this.
* if delete my work doesn't update associated panel icon yet.
* deleting removes selection
* opening a record shouldn't remove selection in list boxes.
* should write this information to the DB instead of the .n2a file?  YES -- contained within profile, which is available anywhere they are.

Profile
* Need to have records in a read-only state for records you don't have access too.  Same to be said for parts, models (permissions)
* Need to add a few more characters, need to have a 'owns' page for models, parts, etc.  
* Publications
* About me
* Interests
* Tags
* Message me

Reference
* Be able to enter a DOI (direct object identifier) as a reference, which would automatically enter in the author, title, etc.

Tags
* When you delete a tag, only the middle table record is deleted, leaving the TermValue record.
* Conundrum: TermValue needs to "Own" its term so that the term is saved if it doesn't exist.
  However, TermValue should not attempt to delete the term when it is deleted.  Deebee only
  has support for one kind of "Owns" (not a "DeleteOwns" & "SaveOwns").
* Ability to search on tags
* When you add a new term twice before saving, it has no chance to use the same record, and
  two are created.  Normally it will find the existing term and use that one (and its case).
* Need a screen to view/edit the descriptions of the terminologies and terms.  Right now
  all term descriptions are blank.
* Not sure why when the terminologies are added for the first time (getAndCreate), '' appears
  in the description.
  
Discussion
* Each record should have a discussion page.
* Posts are "saved" immediately to the record.  Don't have to save the record.
* Would be nice if the user didn't have to "referesh" like on a standard forum, if new records were just auto-populated.

Welcome Page
* News, Stats, Who's Online?
* Some kind of statistics page showing counts of various things in the database and/or usage volume (more political / marketing, but cool)
  
Bugs: 
* Changing Show UID's doesn't affect Compartment/Uses immediately.

Functions:
* User-defined, sharable functions, This can be done in way of plugins... but how
in way of textual definitions that can be pushed/pulled?

Need to refactor the code to not have lists of instanceof!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Generic tree issue:
    even if a node has collapsible false... adding a child node to the parent,
    even via the table model insert method, doesn't cause the expansion!... saw
    this with the root issue earlier and it is happening on summary/tree/eqn nodes 
Generic table issue:
    how to have a nice API that uses the N2A scheme of {min, pref, max} for column widths
    how to make an editable cell in a JTable replace it's
    value when you start typing? instead of appending to existing content.
    have ability to add a clickedinempty listener that you can just subscribe to

Errors: 
 * Let's say someone opens and changes record on client A, and someone deletes that record on client B.  Then client A tries to save - error.
 * Same problem with canceling that same record.  revertBean fails since there no longer is a record to which to revert.
 * For some reason equations don't show up on Izy connections.  do show up after eqn is added... UI refresh issue?
 * Workpane lists not showing up on laptop.
 
Deebee TODO: add count() & count(query) for each bean class 
    
Summary Text Help:    
The following output represents the final equation set for
this COMP/CONN.  Local equations are layered with inherited
equations, overriding where necessary, and component compartments'
equations are included as well with their proper namespace prefix
prepended (THIS SHOULD MAYBE ALL JUST BE IN SOME HELP WIN SOMEWHERE).
Explain the format -- why are there multiple entries possible for each symbol?
also, note they're in alphabetical order    
    
The way it is implemented now, can easily create parent/include loops by just having two records open, setting the 
appropriate fields to one another and then saving both, since the validation only happens on the 
select dialog.

case senstivitiy clashing warnings
summary... double click goes to equation tab.
add includes from summary tree?
different hierarchy set up - not parent, grandparent in linear order, but rather a part centric view - has 1 parent, includes have 1 parent too.

TODO: Some of the record operations do weird things if the record behind the record panel UI has been deleted (could have better error messages and/or behavior).

UQ / SA Comments:
2.  Fixed params instead of default values?
3.  Random seed support
4.  Run & Est Dur look like part of parameter information
5.  Replicate / repeat all x times option?
6.  Regenerate button to produce new values for randomly-generated variables.

Note the things it can't do at this point (not things I don't think might have value, just things it doesn't do): 
1.  Iteration over simulators / environments, you have to manually create multiple run ensembles.
2.  Arbitrary include/exclude hierarchy parameter spaces (don't visit & visit spaces)
3.  Non-uniform random variable distributions (planning on adding others later as needed)
4.  Can't have different output parameters per run in a run ensemble.
